#Problem: 
The Bridge of Lanka  In the epic Ramayana, Lord Rama, with the help of his army of monkeys, built a bridge (Rama Setu) to cross the ocean and reach Lanka. The bridge was constructed using large stones, and each stone was assigned a number. However, the stones were magical and had a rule only stones whose sum of values were divisible by 5 could be used to build the bridge.  One day, Lord Rama decided to test his army's ability to select the correct stones for the bridge.  He provided them with a sequence of stone values, and they had to find the largest subsequence of stones where the sum of the stone values is divisible by 5.  Lord Rama said, "Find the largest consecutive subsequence of stones such that the sum of their values is divisible by 5. If there are multiple sub-sequences with the same sum, return the one with the longest length. If no such subsequence exists, return empty
